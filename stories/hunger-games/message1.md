This message is sent by Peeta to Katniss.

## Body
Hi Katniss this is Peeta! I have successfully managed to infiltrate Capitol City! I have found a place where to hide myself in the train from District 12: you were right, peacekeepers did not check the last wagon, they were too lazy. I am sorry I could not send you a message before but it was difficult to find a safe way to communicate, Caesar controls all broadcast communication channels here in Capitol, so I needed to find a way not to be caught.

I'm happy to tell you my mission is complete, however you are not going to like what I have to tell you. Capitol is already preparing for the Resistance's strike. President Snow has ordered the peripheral districts of the town to be evacuated, now citizens are mostly concentrated in the blocks surrounding the President's palace. I was wondering why this move, so I had to investigate more (which is why it took so long): President Snow is setting up traps and killing machines to make display of our deaths when we invade the city. There are many of them, too many!

But I have good news! These weeks I have been working to track all traps and I am creating a database of them. We can store this information in our tracking devices so that, when we invade the city, we can escape these killing machines. I have already mapped 80 percent of all traps, I have stored this information in a secret place. You know the protocol! It was easier to send this information to your sister Prim, she has the data and now she is in District 8, go fetch the data and give all the information to Plutarch, he can build a tracking device based on that. Good luck!
