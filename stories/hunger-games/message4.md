## Body
Hi Peeta. We need more information from Capitol about District 2! I am writing from District 8 where a great part of our army is assembled and we are ready to attack. However we have just acquired recent information about Capitol's defense system and weapons which make us very worried. It seems that we have underestimated our enemy and they have much more fire power than we thought. I always thought that President Snow had a secret arsenal somewhere, and I am afraid now this is real.

As you well know, District 2 is Capitol's defense system headquarters. From District 2 Capitol is able to control: jets, missiles, air strikes and more. We need to take control of District 2 in order to shut down their defense system. The problem is that the base is hidden inside a mountain, District 2 is completely inaccessible from outside unless we have the access codes. Those codes are stored in a secret place that only President Snow and his generals know. Peeta you must find a way to get those codes, you are the only one who can get access to them because you are already in Capitol and now every access to the city has been closed by President Snow.

I have more details for you about the access codes. President Snow knows that we want to attack District 2 to get control of Capitol's defense system, so he has changed all the codes. It means that his generals do not have the new codes anymore, only the President has them. You must find a way to enter President Snow's building and retrieve the codes. Every access to the house is blocked, but the underground area is not protected. You can use some tunnels built by Capitol's Metro System that run just below the house, from there you can get inside the building. Go to our secret deposit in the periphery of Capitol City (coffee bar) and use passcode "mountain" to open the doors, in the deposit you will find the maps of President Snow's bulding. Find the codes and send them to District 4, I will be there waiting for those. Good luck!
